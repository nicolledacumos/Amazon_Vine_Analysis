The calculations indicate that the majority of reviews were unpaid (99.6%), while only (0.3%) of reviews were paid. Additionally, out of the 15711 total five-star reviews, only 48 were paid reviews.

## Summary

The calculated data suggests that paid users did not primarily write favorable reviews. Most five-star reviewers were unpaid, indicating that furhter calculations may be appropriatei n order to fully determien hte trend in paid vs. unpaid review star ratings.
